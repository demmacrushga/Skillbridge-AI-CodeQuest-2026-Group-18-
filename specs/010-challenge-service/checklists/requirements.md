# Specification Quality Checklist: Challenge Service

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed: scoring owner (posting recruiter),
  duplicate submission handling (409, consistent with matching-service), and leaderboard
  identity (studentId — Constitution I forbids cross-service user reads) all have
  defensible defaults documented in the spec's Assumptions.
- Two deliberate, documented departures from the docs/api.md sketch: leaderboard returns
  `studentId` (no names), and `GET /challenge` requires authentication (Constitution II).
